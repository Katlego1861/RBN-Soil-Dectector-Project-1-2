# RBN-Soil-Dectector-Project-1-2
This project is a **Soil Moisture Detection Tool** designed to measure soil moisture levels and help monitor plant health.  
The circuit and Arduino code were developed and simulated in **TinkerCAD**, while the casing and assembly design were created in **Onshape**.
